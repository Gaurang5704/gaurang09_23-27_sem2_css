<!-- 2. Write a HTML/CSS program to develop a static 
Web Page for Shopping Cart. -->

<!-- Theory: 
This HTML code embodies the essence of a sophisticated shopping cart 
page, meticulously structured to offer users a seamless browsing 
experience. Each item is meticulously arranged within its section, 
complete with detailed product information, intuitive quantity 
adjustment options, and clear pricing details. The CSS further 
enhances the page's visual appeal, employing responsive design 
principles to ensure optimal display across various devices. By 
leveraging classes effectively in both HTML and CSS, the code promotes 
code reusability and facilitates streamlined maintenance, culminating 
in a polished and user-friendly shopping interface. -->
